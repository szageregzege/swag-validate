# The first `INTERNAL` enum value is an example of an internal
# or pre-release enum value the `_publication.yaml` file sets to
# `exclude` from publication and distribution. Since it's
# difficult to reliably express an array location as a JSON
# Pointer expression, recommend positioning any items to
# suppress at the start of the array.
