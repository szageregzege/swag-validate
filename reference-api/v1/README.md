Our [API doc
requirements](https://collaborate.akamai.com/confluence/display/AUE/Swagger+Requirements+for+API+Documentation)
describe how to arrange sets of Swagger files for use in
documentation, and for distribution to customers.  To clarify many
details, this reference API represents a sample implementation of a
hypothetical API service.  Both developers who deploy APIs and tech
writers who document them need to be familiar with these components.

- Consult the source files' `#`-prefixed comments for many useful
guidances laced with RFC keywords MUST, SHOULD, WILL, and MAY.

- Any comments marked `RAML` refer to newly introduced practices that
vary from our prior RAML-based documentation workflow.
